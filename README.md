# Kaboodle Front End Developer Test

## Task

Design and build a basic prototype listing UI for Accommodations and Rooms, similar to what you might see on booking.com, populated from the given data in the two json files.

Accommodation display should show:

- Accommodation Name
- Description
- Type
- Facilities

Room display should show:

- Room Name
- Room Type
- Min & Max Occupancy
- Price of the Room
- Number Available / Sold Out

Styling can be as basic and minimal as you like, you can use existing frameworks if you want.

If you feel the need you can add filtering / sorting / paging / any other useful enhancements.
