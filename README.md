# Kaboodle Front End Developer Test

## Task

Design and build a basic prototype listing UI for Accommodations and Rooms, similar to what you might see on booking.com, populated from the given data in the two json files.

Accommodation display should show:

- Accommodation Name
- Description
- Type
- Facilities

Room display should show:

- Room Name
- Room Type
- Min & Max Occupancy
- Price of the Room
- Number Available / Sold Out

Styling can be as basic and minimal as you like, you can use existing frameworks if you want.

If you feel the need you can add filtering / sorting / paging / any other useful enhancements.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
